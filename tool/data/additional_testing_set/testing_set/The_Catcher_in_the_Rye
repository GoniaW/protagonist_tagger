Old Phoebe tried on about twenty pairs, and each time the poor guy had to lace one shoe all the way up.
Stradlater wasn't hardly listening.
Anyway, I was telling you about that afternoon Jane.
I told him it was Stradlater's.
Perhaps you know my son, then, Ernest Morrow?
Shirley you said you were sagitarius but your only taurus bring your skates when you come over to my house I sat there on D.B.'s desk and read the whole notebook.
He was telling us all about what a swell guy he was, what a hot-shot and all, then all of a sudden this guy sitting in the row in front of me, Edgar Marsalla, laid this terrific fart.
I remember once, the summer I was around twelve, teeing off and all, and having a hunch that if I turned around all of a sudden, I'd see Allie.
I dropped old Phoebe's record.
Take the Disciples, for instance.
And Ring Lardner, except that D.B. told me he's dead.
She took the note off me and called some other lady, from the next office, and the other lady went to give it to Phoebe.
I didn't have any pajamas either and Mr. Antolini forgot to lend me some.
" Old Luce'd say, "Certainly."
But I certainly wasn't going to sit down at a table with old Lillian Simmons and that Navy guy and be bored to death.
"You from Princeton College?"
" I laughed, and Mrs. Antolini yelled something in to me from the kitchen, but I couldn't hear her.
What it was, it was Mr. Antolini's hand.
Holden, come join us," old Lillian said.
I wished old Phoebe was around.
Finally old Mrs. Spencer opened it.
The trouble was, I knew that guy Stradlater's technique.
Hey," Stradlater said.
I forgot she always sleeps in D.B.'s room when he's away in Hollywood or some place.
But the thing was, I'd made that date to go to a matinee with old Sally Hayes, and I needed to keep some dough for the tickets and stuff.
Let's go, chief," old Maurice said.
She killed Allie, too.
I'd rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw.
"What's different about it? Nothin's different about it," Horwitz said.
Cut it out, Holden, for Chrissake!"
They were mostly old, show-offy-looking guys with their dates.
You should've seen old Phoebe.
She told me I could sleep with her if I wanted to, but I said no, that I'd better beat it, that Mr. Antolini was waiting for me and all.
If you try to have a little intelligent--" "Now, listen," old Sally said.
As soon as I got it, I turned around and started running down the other side of the hill, toward old Spencer's house.
I told him, in this very casual voice, to take me up to the Dicksteins'.
She was about sixty years older than Mr. Antolini, but they seemed to get along quite well.
They were always showing Columbus discovering America, having one helluva time getting old Ferdinand and Isabella to lend him the dough to buy ships with, and then the sailors mutinying on him and all.
Then she invited me to visit Ernie during the summer, at Gloucester, Massachusetts.
We tried to get old Marsalla to rip off another one, right while old Thurmer was making his speech, but be wasn't in the right mood.
"Have a seat there, boy," old Spencer said.
D.B. took Phoebe and I to see it last year.
Then I stayed on the floor a fairly long time, sort of the way I did with Stradlater.
Old Luce knew who every flit and Lesbian in the United States was.
Especially my mother, because she still isn't over my brother Allie yet.
You want to be Benedict Arnold, don't you?"
Ackley was a very nosy bastard.
All of a sudden, this girl came up to me and said, "Holden Caulfield!" Her name was Lillian Simmons.
He was the one that finally picked up that boy that jumped out the window I told you about, James Castle.
Please, Allie."
On my right there was this very Joe Yale-looking guy, in a gray flannel suit and one of those flitty-looking Tattersall vests.
As soon as old Maurice opened the doors, he'd see me with the automatic in my hand and he'd start screaming at me, in this very high-pitched, yellowbelly voice, to leave him alone.
She tells old Alec he's really a duke and all, but he doesn't believe her and doesn't want to go with her to visit his mother and all.
There was this one boy at Elkton Hills, named James Castle
Jane, and this man, Mr. Antolini, that was my teacher at Elkton Hills, and my father's office number.
So what I did, I wrote about my brother Allie's baseball mitt.
He knew old Sally Hayes.
D.B. isn't as bad as the rest of them, but he keeps asking me a lot of questions, too.
Mr. Antolini asked me.
Then, pretty soon, the guy that played the piano for old Valencia, this very wavyhaired, flitty-looking guy, came in to comb his golden locks.
What it was, it was Mr. Antolini's hand.
It has a very good academic rating, Pencey.
All old Mr. Antolini had was another highball, though.
As soon as we sat down, old Sally took off her gloves, and I gave her a cigarette.
She was the only one, outside my family, that I ever showed Allie's baseball mitt to, with all the poems written on it.
My mother didn't think Jane was pretty, even.
"I have to make a phone call," I told Phoebe.
It's one of the reasons why I roomed with a stupid bastard like Stradlater.
He was at least a pretty friendly guy, Stradlater.
I sat there on D.B.'s desk and read the whole notebook.
I thought how Phoebe and all the other little kids would see it, and how they'd wonder what the hell it meant, and then finally some dirty kid would tell them--all cockeyed, naturally--what it meant, and how they'd all think about it and maybe even worry about it for a couple of days.
It was partly a phony kind of friendly, but at least he always said hello to Ackley and all.
"Have a seat there, boy," old Spencer said.
Anyway, when he was finished, and everybody was clapping their heads off, old Ernie turned around on his stool and gave this very phony, humble bow.
My kid sister Phoebe goes to bed around nine o'clock-- so I couldn't call her up.
" Stradlater didn't say anything.
She was dating this terrible guy, Al Pike, that went to Choate.
If a white girl was singing it, she'd make it sound cute as hell, but old Estelle Fletcher knew what the hell she was doing, and it was one of the best records I ever heard.
I refuse to answer any typical Caulfield questions tonight.
The blonde one, old Bernice, was drinking bourbon and water.
Ernie's is this night club in Greenwich Village that my brother D.B. used to go to quite frequently before he went out to Hollywood and prostituted himself.
"He's got this goddam superior attitude all the time," Ackley said.
Old Ackley put his hand up so the light wouldn't hurt his eyes.
Monsieur Blanchard was his name, I can still remember.
Stradlater nodded.
Old Phoebe didn't say anything.
What I did, I started talking, sort of out loud, to Allie.
All of a sudden, he said, "For Chrissake, Holden.
Mr. and Mrs. Antolini had this very swanky apartment over on Sutton Place, with two steps that you go down to get in the living room, and a bar and all.
Hey, Horwitz," I said.
Old Sally kept saying, "I know that boy from somewhere.
It took me about an hour, because I had to use Stradlater's lousy typewriter, and it kept jamming on me.
Mr. Antolini didn't say anything for a while.
Go wash your face," Stradlater said.
Then I said, "The reason you're sore at Stradlater is because he said that stuff about brushing your teeth once in a while.
I wouldn't mind calling this Isak Dinesen up.
She kept calling me Rudolf.
So what I did finally, I gave old Carl Luce a buzz.
Suspense is good for some bastards like Stradlater.
When the weather's nice, my parents go out quite frequently and stick a bunch of flowers on old Allie's grave.
