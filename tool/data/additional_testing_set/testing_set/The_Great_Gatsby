"Don't you call me 'old sport'!" cried Tom.
Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms.
"Sit down Daisy." Tom's voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note.
"I talked with Miss Baker," I said after a moment.
"Don't do it today," Gatsby answered.
" There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly taken apparently when he was about eighteen.
He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could "come over" some afternoon to a stranger's garden.
Was Daisy driving?"
" They shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby's face.
"What was the name of the woman?" asked Mrs. McKee.
"Look here, old sport," said Gatsby, leaning toward me, "I'm afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car.
The chauffeur he was one of Wolfshiem's protégés heard the shots afterward he could only say that he hadn't thought anything much about them.
The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic their retinas are one yard high.
"I talked with Miss Baker," I said after a moment.
Sure he went," Mr. Wolfshiem's nose flashed at me indignantly "He turned around in the door and says, 'Don't let that waiter take away my coffee!'
"Make us a cold drink," cried Daisy.
"It's a swell suite," whispered Jordan respectfully and every one laughed.
Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor in the shallows along shore.
James Gatz that was really, or at least legally, his name.
weWell, these books are all scientific," insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently.
"Myrtle'll be hurt if you don't come up to the apartment.
The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby was not there.
He doesn't know very much about Tom, though he says he's read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy's name.
"About Gatsby."
"She doesn't look like her father," explained Daisy.
"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy," I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret.
"We've got enough to get us to town," said Tom.
Oh no," objected Tom quickly, "Not me.
"What you doing, Nick?"
But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained "the polo player" for the rest of the evening.
Did you see that?" demanded Tom.
" Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.
Have you read 'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?"
Gatsby's house was still empty when I left the grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine.
The fact was infinitely astonishing to him and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the man it was the late patron of Gatsby's library.
" Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.
By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man."
"We'll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby," she suggested.
I'm all right now, Mr. " "Carraway."
"Why " she said hesitantly, "Tom's got some woman in New York."
Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby's car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat leaving them out of sight behind.
Dan Cody drunk might soon be about and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby.
From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the state senator and Newton Orchid who controlled Films Par Excellence and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another.
Mr. Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction.
I looked at the house: there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy's room on the second floor.
I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota.
The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went inside.
Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little
At this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.
And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife.
But if I hadn't met Chester, he'd of got me sure."
"I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed.
Tom's words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby. "
"That's right," corroborated Tom kindly.
So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn't say a word instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he'd been doing at certain times on certain days.
As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn's Wedding March from the ballroom below.
"Wreck!" said Tom.
The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air.
"Anything to say about what?" inquired Gatsby politely.
"Meyer Wolfshiem?
"We'll go downstairs," interrupted Gatsby.
When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a Victoria through Central Park.
But as they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes, his protest continued in my brain. "
As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.
He had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose " "Things went from bad to worse," suggested Miss Baker.
In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O'Brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer who had his nose shot off in the war and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiance, and Ardita Fitz-Peters, and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something whom we called Duke and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.
But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived there it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him.
One October day in nineteen-seventeen (said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel) I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns.
"Who wants to go to town?" demanded Daisy insistently.
He hadn't once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes.
" I glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin.
I called Gatsby's house a few minutes later, but the line was busy.
Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend then his foot came down hard and the coup raced along through the night.
It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms but apparently there were no such intentions in her head.
Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.
Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!" cried Jordan dismally.
Good night, Nick," said Daisy.
When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.
"Not at Kapiolani?" demanded Tom suddenly. "
Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases and went haughtily in.
Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door.
Everybody kept saying to me: 'Lucille, that man's way below you!'
"I beg your pardon," said Mr. Wolfshiem, "I had a wrong man.
His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his own.
"Big chance," Wilson smiled faintly. "
Mr. Gatsby's dead.
A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy's fur collar.
"This is Mr. Carraway," I said.
Then Tom's voice, incredulous and insulting: "You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven."
But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.
I followed Tom inside.
The notion originated with Daisy's suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as "a place to have a mint julep.
"If Chester could only get you in that pose
After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby's party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world.
And inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music rooms and Restoration salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through.
I suppose there'd be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer and Myrtle Wilson's tragic achievement was forgotten.
They arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds Daisy's voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.
"I don't see the idea of going to town," broke out Tom savagely.
"Not Gatsby," I said shortly.
Suddenly with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.
