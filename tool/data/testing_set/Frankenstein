It was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood.
The name of the old man was De Lacey.
I have seen, he said, the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders.
My dear Frankenstein, exclaimed he, how glad I am to see you!
The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin.
Listen to me, Frankenstein.
I stretched out my hand to him and cried, Are you then safe and Elizabeth and Ernest?
But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas books of voyages.
My dear Victor, do not speak thus.
The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volneys Ruins of Empires.
Walton, in continuation.
Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit?
Justine started.
In M. Waldman I found a true friend.
He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.
Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian.
It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found.
And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift
Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which one must fall.
“D—n the fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all.
Felix had procured passports in the name of his father, sister, and himself.
The course of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque.
Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came.
Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.
She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at Chne, a village situated at about a league from Geneva.
Dearest Clerval, exclaimed I, how kind, how very good you are to me.
Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind.
Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix.
I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation.
Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary.
The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands.
Rise, my poor girl, said Elizabeth
My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that I bore.
The generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate.
It is utterly useless, replied Felix; we can never again inhabit your cottage.
I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.
Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave, and I the cause!
I attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable.
The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited.
But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful!
Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving youhe bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!
The girl was called sister or Agatha, and the youth Felix, brother, or son.
Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed.
Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.
She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad.
Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears.
M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits.
Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished him.
When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer.
Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness.
But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.
The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.
The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears,
My aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house.
I wrote to Elizabeth.
So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.
I am happy, said M. Waldman, to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success.
The plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison.
Felix was too delicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness.
Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion?
From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth.
Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked to see them
We were soon joined by Elizabeth.
Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy
: I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.
Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.
The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotenceand
The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover.
The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety.
When I thought of my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me.
I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha.
M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences.
Poor Clerval!
Through my fathers exertions a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian government.
This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land, perhaps, for many years.
Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.
I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.
Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange chances that have lately occurred.
You are forbidden to write to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions.
We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!
That she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.
Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin
Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?
Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.
And you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections.
Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt.
Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace.
Begone, vile insect!
M. Frankenstein he will punish you.
Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.
Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court.
Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it.
Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.
Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm.
Everyone loved Elizabeth.
There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour.
My dear Victor, You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you.
Your family is perfectly well, said Mr. Kirwin with gentleness; and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.
Every minute, continued M. Krempe with warmth, every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost.
During all that time Henry was my only nurse.
