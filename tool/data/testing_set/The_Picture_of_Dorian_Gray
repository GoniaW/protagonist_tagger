"By the way, Dorian," he said after a pause, "'what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose how does the quotation run?
"I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you.
What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane's death?
Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead.
"Yes," murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; "and when they grow older they know it.
"What are you two talking about?" said Lord Henry, strolling over to the table and putting his cup down.
"What nonsense, Dorian!" laughed his companion, and as the hare bounded into the thicket, he fired.
Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book.
" The favourites of James I wore ear-rings of emeralds set in gold filigrane.
Sibyl felt oppressed.
It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.
Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any tragedy of our age.
"Don't speak about those days, Dorian they are dead."
"I don't want it put straight, Leaf.
And Basil?
Dorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain.
My God, Harry, how I worship her!"
The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the dress-circle, stamped and swore with rage.
"My God! my God!" he cried, "and I would have murdered you!" Dorian Gray drew a long breath.
Mr. Hubbard was a florid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the artists who dealt with him.
Sir Thomas frowned.
The old Jew stood grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom, making elaborate speeches about us both, while we stood looking at each other like children.
"My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill," interrupted Hallward.
What of George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and fantastic patches?
It had made him conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane.
"I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian," said the painter coldly when he had recovered from his surprise.
Why, they will hang me, Alan!
"Basil, this is extraordinary!
"Good God, Dorian, what a lesson! What an awful lesson!" There was no answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window.
He realized that, and when he had locked the door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he had thrust Basil Hallward's coat and bag.
"I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be put in that way to the public.
Lord Henry, don't you think that Mr. Gray should get married?"
Am I to go, Mr. Gray?"
"Years ago, when I was a boy," said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in his hand, "you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my good looks.
"You are flirting disgracefully with him," said Lord Henry to his cousin.
"I am waiting, Basil," said the young man in a hard clear voice.
Lord Henry laughed.
You remember the one I wore at Lady Hilstone's garden-party?
"The people are still discussing poor Basil's disappearance."
Lord Henry passed up the low arcade into Burlington Street and turned his steps in the direction of Berkeley Square.
A groan broke from Campbell's lips and he shivered all over.
He thought only of Sibyl.
Yes, she was certainly lovely to look at one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought, that he had ever seen.
"Before either." "I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry," said the lad.
You don't really mind, Basil, do you?
Mr. Erskine listened.
"I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane."
"Let us sit down, Dorian," said the painter, looking troubled.
I didn't hear what Harry said.
Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it.
"What sort of ways, Basil?"
Then we must get her out of the Jew's hands.
I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the stage.
I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other.
He was so unlike Basil.
"I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?" said Lord Henry that evening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol where dinner had been laid for three.
Yet, after some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his box at the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt pleasure to "Tannhauser" and seeing in the prelude to that great work of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul.
Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with pallid face and tear-stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over to the deal painting-table that was set beneath the high curtained window.
"What is it all about?" cried Dorian in his petulant way, flinging himself down on the sofa.
It is an odd thing, but every one who disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco.
I am in love with it, Basil.
"The only horrible thing in the world is ennui, Dorian.
"You must introduce me now," cried Lord Henry, laughing.
When the Huns lured the king into the great pit, he flung it away Procopius tells the story nor was it ever found again, though the Emperor Anastasius offered five hundred-weight of gold pieces for it.
It belongs to Nature, not to me.
You are hard on her, Harry!" said Hallward listlessly.
"I hate them for it," cried Hallward.
Adrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar.
He moved slowly towards it, passing Hallward as he did so.
It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who was a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the remains of really remarkable ugliness.
Hallward turned pale and caught his hand.
It is rather awkward for Geoffrey, of course.
There were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it had been in his brain and in his passions.
"Ah, then," said Lord Henry, rising to go, "then, my dear Dorian, you would have to fight for your victories.
It was an extraordinary improvisation.
The harsh intervals and shrill discords of barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert's grace, and Chopin's beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell unheeded on his ear.
Dorian, if it would please you.
It is only people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay mine.
"I don't like that explanation, Harry," he rejoined, "but I am glad you don't think I am heartless.
James Vane looked into his sister's face with tenderness.
I tell you, Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me.
Dorian recognized him.
"Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way!
Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of black velvet powdered with crescents and suns.
You let Harry know."
Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane are two things that I shall never forget.
Good-bye, Uncle George.
"You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane," was the answer, "and Sibyl Vane was my sister.
Besides, how do you know that Hetty isn't floating at the present moment in some starlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies round her, like Ophelia?"
Thank God, I have not got his blood upon my hands.
Basil Hallward's compliments had seemed to him to be merely the charming exaggeration of friendship.
"In this fog, my dear Basil?
Women who had wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.
"You must lend me these, Basil," he cried.
His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him.
So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil?
He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out.
"It is about yourself," answered Hallward in his grave deep voice, "and I must say it to you.
"I wonder is that really so, Harry?" said Dorian Gray, putting some perfume on his handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle that stood on the table.
"It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done," said Lord Henry languidly.
