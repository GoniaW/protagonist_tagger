I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him; yes: she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.
She had Roman features and a double chin, disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost preternatural erectness.
Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account of the awfully sudden death of Martha G -, a naughty child addicted to falsehood and deceit.'
Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.
Hannah soon had a lantern lit.
Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie, it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not no, I was sure of it, and am still it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole." As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: "Is Miss Eyre here?"
"No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what I wished to gain."
Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort
"Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still too."
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.
Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did: while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my bad propensities.
I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."
This very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must choose some dresses for yourself.
I heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general wrath; doubtless she shared in it.
Mr. St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses:
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern much less gloomy.
"And are the family well at the house, Robert?"
"Did you like him, Jane?"
"I came to see you, Helen
"Taste the wine again, Jane."
"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the parlour door.
Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a great service the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued me, by your noble hospitality, from death.
He had been called away by the sudden death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay there a fortnight longer."
"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?
"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered; "without it, my heart is broken.
Diana Rivers had designated her brother "inexorable as death."
"You shall," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative sincerity which seemed natural to her.
I am an old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at Thornfield Hall.
The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a false front of French curls.
When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm continued all night.
Don't shut the door: oh, don't, for God's sake!"
Having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost.
Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a remark, but she said nothing.
The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.
At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to stay another week.
"Our uncle John is dead," said he.
"How is Mrs. Reed?"
St. John continued "It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.
Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children.
Rosamond a missionary's wife?
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was sewing, I was watching her.
" I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr. Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the conversation was turned into another channel.
The couple were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,' shining in satin and jewels, my gifts of course, and there was her companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a vicomte a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so absolutely.
" I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at the price of caste. "
"Do you know Mr. Rochester?"
Tell me what business St. John and you have on hands.
"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me, because I am used to the sight of the demon.
Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
Mr. Rochester continued "Adele showed me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.
"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
"Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?"
"What age were you when you went to Lowood?"
" I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature, straight and tall as poplars.
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot ran a race with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.
"That is my little boy," said Bessie directly.
How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
"Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst, and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst."
Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr. Rochester.
"No, Mrs. Reed."
Blanche Ingram, after having repelled, by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of absence.
It is better so: Hannah shall go with you."
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was selecting certain of their number to be of his party. "
"Are there any letters for J.E.?" I asked.
Miss Fairfax?
I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time: there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a slight trouble a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might be whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend and be benignant.
"Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.
"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr. Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.
"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
" Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt a portion of French by heart daily applying myself to take pains with my accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela.
"And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by you to seek a place, I suppose?"
Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of that time she transferred it to a place you know being no other than Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.
Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a saucepan.
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed both my ears, and then left me without a word.
Bessie answered that I was doing very well. "
"She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."
Some time passed before he spoke; he at last said "Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."
"St John was only twenty-nine, sir."
A negotiation was opened through the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro, till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise
Did you hear her, Eliza and Georgiana?
Madam, Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?
That must be matter of fact.
It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general holiday approached.
you revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!
Come, Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.
But Helen was ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I knew not what room upstairs.
Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude observation.
"It is Jane Eyre, sir."
I was received at the foot of the stairs by Mr. Rochester.
When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well: you have some sense."
"Come, Jane come hither."
Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a tendency to deceit.
It was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole."
Mrs. Reed would have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
I had Leah in to read to me sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt it confining.
The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure; with a very pretty face, of that order the French term minois chiffone: both sisters were fair as lilies.
Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric at least.
Hannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up.
I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.
