Step forward, George Jackson.
I ain't as rich as old Jim Hornback, and I can't be so blame'
So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.
The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me.
So did Jim.
Jim throwed some old rags over him, but he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him.
Judge Thatcher's got it.
I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a snag, maybe, and it was all up with him.
Boggs rode off blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street; and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping it up.
Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn't tell nobody; and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and says: “I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger.
By and by somebody sings out: “Here comes old Boggs! in from the country for his little old monthly drunk; here he comes, boys!” All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out of Boggs.
Jim and me got uneasy.
Jim said he didn't believe he could go any further so scared he hadn't hardly any strength left, he said.
Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of work weeks of it hours and hours, every night, whilst you was all asleep.
Jim was gone!
And there's Jim chained by one leg, with a ten foot chain, to the leg of his bed: why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain.
Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.
Jim says: “Why, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arm; I hain't got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.”
But Tom he showed him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, sure.
I mean every word I say, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don't go, I'll go.
“But, Huck, it's all jis' as plain to me as ”
Don't forget and tell me it's Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it's George Elexander when I catch you.
All right I don't care where he comes out, so he comes out; and Jim don't, either, I reckon.
Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?
You Peter Wilks's brother!
But we got under all right, and out through the hole, swift but soft Jim first, me next, and Tom last, which was according to Tom's orders.
Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried to write he see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper.
Jim's eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too.
So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on, and read it.
IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat trap and fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat hole, and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put it in a safe place under Aunt Sally's bed.
Jim's right, anyway, when he says he ain't got no coat of arms, because he hain't.
I got to tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it's a bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain't no help for it.
Sally, it's terrible just terrible
“I wisht you'd len' me a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had”
Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.
Tom, if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it, I says, there's an old rusty saw blade around yonder sticking under the weather boarding behind the smoke house.
When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.
Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money take it all.
Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, Oh, yes, it's mighty likely!
Don't say yes'm say Aunt Sally.
They read like this: Shaksperean Revival!!!
Jim said nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.
Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body's mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again.
Well, this is it, Capet.
That ain't got anything to do with it, Huck Finn.
Well, we can't resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn't take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans.
Tom said she was going to get one of us, sure, before we got through.
Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim did you catch her?
Where's Jim?
While I was at it he asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went out.
Then I thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s'pose you'd a done right and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now?
The woods warn't thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet, and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away the way he come to get his hat
So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn't behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.
Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him.
I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.
“Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard! I'll never forgit you long's I live!” says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.
But, Jim, you got to have 'em they all do.
So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench's frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the way Tom told me to.
I 'uz powerful sorry you's killed, Huck, but I ain't no mo' now.
You must a met him on the road, didn't you? oldish man, with a ” “No, I didn't see nobody, Aunt Sally.
“Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?”
Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty five, and tall and proud and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn't stirred up; but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks, like her father.
“That's what Miss Mary Jane said.”
The fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.
e said Tom Sawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what I had.
I was at Judge Thatcher's as quick as I could get there.
 why, where is Tom?
The king he reads it and puts it in his pocket, and says: Poor William, afflicted as he is, his heart's aluz right.
Well, then, what we going to do, Tom? I'll tell you.
Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man's britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and Jim used to do before.
Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, “Oh, yes, it's mighty likely!” and shook me up again, and said he reckoned he'd drownd me.
Hold on, Parker, says the other man, here's a twenty to put on the board for me.
“These old letters is from Harvey Wilks; and here's these two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't write them”
Why, Hare l why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year's end to year's end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor nigger shows, nor nowheres.”
“Set her back, John, set her back!” says one.
He says: Doan' le's talk about it, Huck.
I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't there.
Don't they give 'em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year's week, and Fourth of July?
I reely don't know, Sally, he says, kind of apologizing, or you know I would tell.
I run along the bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was so glad to see me.
Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.
Ole missus dat's Miss Watson she pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she wouldn' sell me down to Orleans.
She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered.
Some think old Finn done it himself.”
I cried a little when I was covering up Buck's face, for he was mighty good to me.
He told me when the roads forked I must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.
But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless.
I rose up, and there was Jackson's Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights.
Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain't got none.
Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob? or what is it?” I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn't know hardly what to do.
By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says: “Don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?” “No,” I says, “it don't.”
It's the way I feel, too, Jim.
This hole's big enough for Jim to get through if we wrench off the board.”
Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick room all day and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him.
But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.
Now trot along to your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what I can to get you out of it.
Miss Hooker was a visiting up there to the town ” “Yes, Booth's Landing go on.”
Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time.
Bill wanted to kill Turner.
Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the worst; her tongue was a going all the time.
