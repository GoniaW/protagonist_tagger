And I pray one prayer I repeat it till my tongue stiffens Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living; you said I killed you haunt me, then!
Mr. Heathcliff,' said I, 'this is the talk of a madman; your wife, most likely, is convinced you are mad; and, for that reason, she has borne with you hitherto: but now that you say she may go, she'll doubtless avail herself of the permission.
The morning was fresh and cool; I threw back the lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents from the garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me, 'Ellen, shut the window. I'm starving!'
Did I ever look so stupid: so "gaumless," as Joseph calls it?'
No, no, Isabella, you shan't run off,' she continued, arresting, with feigned playfulness, the confounded girl, who had risen indignantly. '
'Poor Hindley!' I exclaimed, involuntarily.
Because misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, you, of your own will, did it.
Her husband took his stand on the hearthstone, near me, and began to put questions concerning Catherine.
'Yes,' answered Mrs. Dean, 'as soon as they are married, and that will be on New Year's Day.'
Only Ellen and I were disputing concerning your health.
'But what do you mean by a change, Mr. Heathcliff?' I said, alarmed at his manner: though he was neither in danger of losing his senses, nor dying, according to my judgment: he was quite strong and healthy; and, as to his reason, from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on dark things, and entertaining odd fancies.
I threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking Mr. Earnshaw by knocking.
Nelly, there is a strange change approaching; I'm in its shadow at present.
When Hareton was there, she generally paused in an interesting part, and left the book lying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was as obstinate as a mule, and, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather he took to smoking with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of the fire, the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense, as he would have called it, the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it.
The Heights were Heathcliff's land, and he was reproving the poacher.
But the country folks, if you ask them, would swear on the Bible that he walks: there are those who speak to having met him near the church, and on the moor, and even within this house.
I swear that I meditate no harm: I don't desire to cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or insult Mr. Linton; I only wish to hear from herself how she is, and why she has been ill; and to ask if anything that I could do would be of use to her.
'Take care, Ellen!' answered Isabella, her eyes sparkling irefully; there was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her partner's endeavours to make himself detested.
Mr. Linton, on his part, spent his time in the library, and did not inquire concerning his wife's occupations.
But I'm hardly going to come to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for ordering Linton to undergo this penance.
On entering the house, I looked about for some one to give information of Catherine.
From Mr. Earnshaw and his companions she kept aloof; and tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of a fit that often attended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she pleased to demand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper.
To be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward and impatient existence she had led, whether she merited a haven of peace at last.
'Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I'm safe!' exclaimed Catherine, weeping bitterly. '
'They are not mine,' said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than Heathcliff himself could have replied.
It was not the case, in reality, I am aware; but it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I thought Heathcliff himself less guilty than I.
Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere visible; and Joseph, whom I followed to the stables, and requested to accompany me in, after staring and muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and replied 'Mim! mim! mim!
His countenance was much older in expression and decision of feature than Mr. Linton's; it looked intelligent, and retained no marks of former degradation.
Edgar stood on the hearth weeping silently, and in the middle of the table sat a little dog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual accusations, we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them.
I've no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in heaven; and if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so low, I shouldn't have thought of it.
Heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a single unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew.
At the top of an extra page (quite a treasure, probably, when first lighted on) I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Joseph, rudely, yet powerfully sketched.
I'd not exchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton's at Thrushcross Grange not if I might have the privilege of flinging Joseph off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with Hindley's blood!'
"Maister Hindley!" shouted our chaplain.
Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here; though, if I had not learned he was out of the way, I'd have halted at the kitchen, washed my face, warmed myself, got you to bring what I wanted, and departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed of that incarnate goblin!
Heathcliff's face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and he sighed. '
Heathcliff's come back he is!'
What kind of living will it be when you oh, God!
I'll extract wholesome medicines from Mrs. Dean's bitter herbs; and firstly, let me beware of the fascination that lurks in Catherine Heathcliff's brilliant eyes.
Gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full, mellow flow of the beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear.
You'll not go, then? kind, sweet, good Catherine!
Mr. Hindley, do take warning.
I gave a few sentences of commendation to Heathcliff, and he, either for a headache or a pang of envy, began to cry: so I got up and left him.'
He began to pace the room, muttering terrible things to himself, till I was inclined to believe, as he said Joseph did, that conscience had turned his heart to an earthly hell.
Hareton, get forwards with the lass.
Nay, you'll not drive me off again.
Hush,' murmured Linton; 'for God's sake, hush!
Catherine was mute.
Whatever he may pretend, he wishes to provoke Edgar to desperation: he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over him; and he sha'n't obtain it I'll die first!
'It's well the hellish villain has kept his word!' growled my future host, searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering Heathcliff; and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and threats of what he would have done had the 'fiend' deceived him.
The Grange is not a prison, Ellen, and you are not my gaoler.
Mr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the place.
Catherine Linton (the very name warms me), my bonny lass, I shall be from home all this week; go and see if have not spoken truth: do, there's a darling!
She could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr. Linton's philosophical resignation.
His childhood's sense of superiority, instilled into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was faded away.
'Hallo, Nelly!' said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw me.
Ellen,' said he, when I entered, 'have you seen your mistress?'
Exhaustion of body had entirely subdued her spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing child.
Isabella, let me in, or I'll make you repent!
Come, you shall take notice of me, Hareton: you are my cousin, and you shall own me.'
Cathy stole to his room to inquire how he was; he had fallen asleep.
'And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him?' was the doctor's next question.
The Crags lie about a mile and a half beyond Mr. Heathcliff's place, and that is four from the Grange, so I began to fear night would fall ere I could reach them.
From their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine, probably, from her thoughts.
Take care, Ellen!'
I was always reading, when I had them,' said Catherine; 'and Mr. Heathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my books.
'The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service, Ellen Dean,' he replied.
Mr. Hareton, I wonder you should have no more wit than to go and make that mess at her bidding!'
'Weel done, Miss Cathy!
It is Linton, I mean.
Don't mention his mother to me,' said the master, angrily.
'What business, sir?' said Nelly, conducting me into the house.
God! he's mad to speak so!'
Make haste, Heathcliff!'
She was much too fond of Heathcliff.
Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his own stall; he was passing behind it, when Hindley finished his speech by knocking him under its feet, and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were fulfilled, ran away as fast as he could.
'The back of the settle and Earnshaw's person interposed between me and him; so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife from the table and flung it at my head.
'Five minutes ago Hareton seemed a personification of my youth, not a human being; I felt to him in such a variety of ways, that it would have been impossible to have accosted him rationally.
In a month or two, my lad, you'll be able to pay her back her present tyrannies with a vigorous hand.
Zillah won't be here to-night; you must undress yourself.
Oh! I'm tired I'm stalled, Hareton!'
'This morning, when I came down, about half an hour before noon, Mr. Earnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick; his evil genius, almost as gaunt and ghastly, leant against the chimney.
Exhaustion of body had entirely subdued her spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing child.'
Mr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to attend the remains of his sister to the grave; he sent no excuse, but he never came; so that, besides her husband, the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants.
I'll console Mr. Edgar by acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff's humour has taken.
'Ech! ech!' exclaimed Joseph.
He opened the mysteries of the Fairy Cave, and twenty other queer places.
Next morning I answered the letter by a slip of paper, inscribed, 'Master Heathcliff is requested to send no more notes to Miss Linton, as she will not receive them.'
I heard him tell Mr. Hindley: and now she has nothing to keep her, and she'll be dead before winter.
We were both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat, and then it was Joseph, shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof, through a trap: the ascent to his garret, I suppose.
One fine summer morning it was the beginning of harvest, I remember Mr. Earnshaw, the old master, came down-stairs, dressed for a journey; and, after he had told Joseph what was to be done during the day, he turned to Hindley, and Cathy, and me for I sat eating my porridge with them and he said, speaking to his son, 'Now, my bonny man, I'm going to Liverpool to-day, what shall I bring you?
Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for taking a new mind about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me, and he was tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my sitting-room, and keep her with me.
Hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her get to her room immediately, or she shouldn't cry for nothing!
'The Lord help us!' he soliloquised in an undertone of peevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime, in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent.
This morning, when I came down, about half an hour before noon, Mr. Earnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick; his evil genius, almost as gaunt and ghastly, leant against the chimney.
Nelly, take him in, and I'll follow your advice concerning the doctor, without delay.'
But in the afternoon, while Joseph and Hareton were at their work, he came into the kitchen again, and, with a wild look, bid me come and sit in the house: he wanted somebody with him.
God forbid that he should try!'
You are a dog in the manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but yourself!'
The notion of envying Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough. '
