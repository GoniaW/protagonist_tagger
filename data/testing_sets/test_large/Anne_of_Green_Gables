Matthew, hastily summoned from the harvest field, was straightway dispatched for the doctor, who in due time came, to discover that the injury was more serious than they had supposed.
“Have you discovered another kindred spirit?”
“You must kneel down,” said Marilla in embarrassment.
“I guess you’re feeling pretty tired and hungry,” Matthew ventured to say at last, accounting for her long visitation of dumbness with the only reason he could think of.
which all the children, and Anne especially, hated.
“It was your own fault,” said Marilla, twitching down the blind and lighting a lamp.
“Well now, I’m much obliged,” said Matthew, “and
But you’re so featherbrained, Anne, I’ve been waiting to see if you’d sober down a little and learn to be steady before I begin.
Anne realized that she had forgiven and forgotten without knowing it.
Anne perched herself on a block and talked the concert over with him, sure of an appreciative and sympathetic listener in this instance at least.
Since then the Avonlea church had enjoyed a variety of religious dissipation in listening to the many and various candidates and “supplies” who came Sunday after Sunday to preach on trial.
“She she’s just referring to some conversation we had on the road,” said Matthew hastily.
“Unromantic fiddlesticks!” said the unsympathetic Marilla.
And my opinion is that you ought to let Anne go.”
“Then you really think I’d better let her stay home,” said Marilla in amazement.
“I’ll go and have another look,” said Marilla, determining to be just.
I’d have brought it over last night, but it didn’t come until after dark, and I never feel very comfortable coming through the Haunted Wood in the dark now.”
It was bad enough to be singled out for punishment from among a dozen equally guilty ones; it was worse still to be sent to sit with a boy, but that that boy should be Gilbert Blythe was heaping insult on injury to a degree utterly unbearable.
she realized what Anne had come to mean to her.
And I’m sure I couldn’t hop so far on one foot when Jane couldn’t even hop around the garden.”
“A bosom friend an intimate friend, you know a really kindred spirit to whom I can confide my inmost soul.
Most of the good folks, not knowing about Marilla’s eyes, thought she was foolish.
So had Gilbert.
Consequently, when Marilla entered her kitchen and found the fire black out, with no sign of Anne anywhere, she felt justly disappointed and irritated.
I’ll wash them when the minister and his wife are gone, but I cannot ever look Mrs. Allan in the face again.
Mrs. Barry came to the kitchen door in answer to Marilla’s knock.
It was admitted that the medal contestants had practically narrowed down to three Gilbert Blythe, Anne Shirley, and Lewis Wilson; the Avery scholarship was more doubtful, any one of a certain six being a possible winner.
“But the picnic is tomorrow, Marilla,” cried Anne.
And another thing, Anne, when I send you after something you’re to bring it at once and not fall into mooning and imagining before pictures.
“Diana might just have smiled at me once, I think,” she mourned to Marilla that night.
And Ruby is in hysterics
“Mrs. Barry told Diana that we might sleep in the spare-room bed.
I’ll take Anne with me and Mrs. Spencer will probably make arrangements to send her back to Nova Scotia at once.
I’m trying to be as much like Mrs. Allan as I possibly can, for I think she’s perfect.
Mrs. Lynde left for you.
Hence, while Marilla and Mrs. Rachel were enjoying themselves hugely at the mass meeting, Anne and Matthew had the cheerful kitchen at Green Gables all to themselves.
whispered Diana.
“Ruby Gillis says she means to have a beau as soon as she’s fifteen,” said Diana.
“Mrs. Allan is perfectly lovely,” she announced one Sunday afternoon.
Now?” asked Marilla, when Anne had just come in from a run to the post office.
But she did hope fervently that she would be among the first ten at least, so that she might see Matthew’s kindly brown eyes gleam with pride in her achievement.
He said it would turn my hair a beautiful raven black he positively assured me that it would.
“I thought Marilla Cuthbert was an old fool when I heard she’d adopted a girl out of an orphan asylum,” she said to herself, “
I did make a mistake in judging Anne, but it weren’t no wonder, for an odder, unexpecteder witch of a child there never was in this world, that
I can’t tell you how ashamed I felt, Marilla, especially when I heard Josie Pye giggling.
Anne did remember it and was back in the stipulated time, although probably no mortal will ever know just what it cost her to confine the discussion of Diana’s important communication within the limits of ten minutes.
But I’ll try to bear it all bravely if only you won’t be cross with me, Marilla.”
“Ten minutes isn’t very long to say an eternal farewell in,” said Anne tearfully.
Matthew and Marilla don’t know anything about children and they’ll expect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather, if so be’s he ever had a grandfather, which is doubtful.
“We’ve got each other, Anne.
Neither was Mrs. Spencer although she generally is.
“Well, we’re not getting a girl,” said Marilla, as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy.
“Whatever’s the matter now, Anne?”
She walked, rowed, berried, and dreamed to her heart’s content; and when September came she was bright-eyed and alert, with a step that would have satisfied the Spencervale doctor and a heart full of ambition and zest once more.
I’m to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and Ruby Gillis is going to lend me her slippers because I haven’t any of my own.
“Why, Robert sent word down by his daughter Nancy and she said you wanted a girl didn’t she Flora Jane?” appealing to her daughter who had come out to the steps.
She had an odd, newly awakened consciousness under all her outraged dignity that the half-shy, half-eager expression in Gilbert’s hazel eyes
“Oh, who was it what was it?” whispered Anne, her teeth chattering with cold and fright.
“Jane’s mother is going to let her have a birthday party?”
Matthew asked forlornly, feeling secretly thankful that Marilla and not he had to deal with the situation.
As Josie was not “speaking” to Jane just then she had to subside into comparative harmlessness.
As it progressed Anne became more and more abstracted, eating mechanically, with her big eyes fixed unswervingly and unseeingly on the sky outside the window.
And anyhow, please forgive Diana and let her have her music lessons.
Mrs. Allan says you look like a Madonna when you part it so.
“But we’re so careful to put a moral into them all, Marilla,” explained Anne.
I’d have said something too sharp to Rachel before everybody.
“I’m so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no Mayflowers,” said Anne.
“Oh yes,” sighed Anne, blissfully unconscious of any sarcasm on Marilla’s part.
I’m going to Redmond in September.
I prayed, Mrs. Allan, most earnestly, but I didn’t shut my eyes to pray, for I knew the only way God could save me was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge piles for me to climb up on it.
Jane and Ruby have been twice, and they’re going this year again.”
And Ruby is in hysterics oh, Anne, how did you escape?”
All these raptured voyages of exploration were made in the odd half hours which she was allowed for play, and Anne talked Matthew and Marilla half-deaf over her discoveries.
“I’ll tell Marilla as soon as she comes in I’ve repented.”
may I call it Bonny while I’m here?
The next day was Sunday and as the rain poured down in torrents from dawn till dusk Anne did not stir abroad from Green Gables.
The retort silenced Matthew if it did not convince him.
“That’s awfully nice raspberry cordial, Anne,” she said.
But Anne Shirley he simply ignored, and Anne found out that it is not pleasant to be ignored.
But Ruby Gillis knows a great deal about such matters because she has so many big sisters, and Mrs. Lynde says the Gillis girls have gone off like hot cakes.
And yet here was Matthew Cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon of a busy day, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill; moreover, he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was plain proof that he was going out of Avonlea; and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare, which betokened that he was going a considerable distance.
Of course it wasn’t exactly necessary to starch Matthew’s handkerchiefs!
Marilla felt that he wanted it just as much this morning as he had the night before, and that he would go on wanting it.
He’s all the time curling his mustache and making eyes at Prissy Andrews.
Sophia Sloane offered to teach her a perfectly elegant new pattern of knit lace, so nice for trimming aprons.
Not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would have seen it if there had been.
Because whenever I was naughty Mrs. Thomas would ask me how I could be such a bad girl when she had brought me up by hand reproachful-like.
Mr. Phillips’s brief reforming energy was over; he didn’t want the bother of punishing a dozen pupils; but it was necessary to do something to save his word, so he looked about for a scapegoat and found it in Anne, who had dropped into her seat, gasping for breath, with a forgotten lily wreath hanging askew over one ear and giving her a particularly rakish and disheveled appearance.
With one bound she crossed the kitchen floor and stood before Mrs. Rachel, her face scarlet with anger, her lips quivering, and her whole slender form trembling from head to foot.
Anne sighed, retreated to the east gable, and sat down in a chair by the window.
Nothing could be worse than giving up Green Gables nothing could hurt me more.
“But you have such strength of mind, Marilla.
Diana said she believed she was born for city life.
It would certainly make a sensation second to none, and Mrs. Rachel dearly loved to make a sensation.
She dresses beautifully, and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody else’s in Avonlea.
“I guess Gilbert Blythe will be in school today,” said Diana.
On Anne’s birthday they were tripping lightly down it, keeping eyes and ears alert amid all their chatter, for Miss Stacy had told them that they must soon write a composition on “A Winter’s Walk in the Woods,” and it behooved them to be observant.
Miss Barry met them at the door with a twinkle in her sharp black eyes.
“Well now, Anne, don’t you think you’d better do it and have it over with?”
Depend upon it, Marilla, she’ll cool off in a week or so and be ready enough to go back of her own accord, that’s what, while, if you were to make her go back right off, dear knows what freak or tantrum
