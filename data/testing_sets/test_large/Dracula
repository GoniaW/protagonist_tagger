When he came out of the room again I told him of Arthur's question, and he replied:  "I am not surprised.
" I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not to disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice.
Then said the Professor as we moved off:  "Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of the clock with friend John.
I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness more than was absolutely required.
On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her mother.
Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man's warmly.
And, my good friend John, let me caution you.
Being practically on the frontier for the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina it has had a very stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks of it.
I pitied the others, especially Arthur.
She says that as a child she used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back, and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not returned.
He came on with me to Hillingham, and found that, by Lucy's discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that we were alone with her.
I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without thinking.
"I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did to-day.
If Arthur only knew!
"Oh, Madam Mina," he said, sadly, "it is proof, if proof be needed, of how I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I am proud to obey!"
I am Mrs. Harker."
God alone knows who, or where, or what, or when, or how it may be....
" Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling them.
Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb.
It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but Van Helsing was unmoved.
Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.
Dr. Seward's Diary.
" I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.
, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would not listen to my objection.
"I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house.
Jonathan sleeping.
"My dearest Lucy,  "Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed with work.
Thank God, Lucy's health keeps up.
"I thank you, sir," said Van Helsing proudly.
Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice.
It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in Dr. Seward's diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb; I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord
How well Disraeli knew life.
Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur's shoulder, and said to him:  "And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?
He had four telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect: that the Czarina Catherine had not been reported to Lloyd's from anywhere.
Another day and no tidings of the Czarina Catherine.
I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew that I had been crying twice in one morning
It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb that he think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like him, keep open to him.
Said Mr. Morris:  "I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and there may be wolves.
After a time it did not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one's blood, no matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling Van Helsing held up a warning finger.
Thank God there is the other copy in the safe!"
Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.
In my husband's diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man's remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general feeling against his class.
But why, dear Madam Mina?
And I!" said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to take the oath.
"When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o' them, the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had been put on board by a queer lookin' old man just before we had started frae London.
Mina appeared not to see them.
The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of.
I could not but feel that Art was keeping back something; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.
So I determined to write only formal notes now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for to her
I shall send for Arthur to come too, and also
We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly in front as he led the way.
Lucy is ever so much better.
The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers.
"Lord  "; but Arthur interrupted him:  
I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round.
When we had finished, Mrs. Harker said:  "Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour?
It was to me a painful meeting, for it brought back all poor dear Lucy's hopes of only a few months ago.
Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel directed to John Seward, M. D. (Not delivered.)
There were only ourselves and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the President of the Incorporated Law Society.
We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time to write later.
Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to see us, and often comes now.
Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for many a long day.
My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without making a scene.
It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was Van Helsing back in the study.
Then he bent down, and, with his face almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully.
Somehow I felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land.
I shall not even feel the change, for last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time.
It is morning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept alive Madam Mina aiding me.
To begin twice more after I had been through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet Miss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the years; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....
I had a horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face I gathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come.
Here comes old Mr. Swales.
Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I did have hunger and appeased it
Till then good-bye, my friend John.
Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake.
She is grieved to lose Lucy as her very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to protect her.
Lucy's eyes in form and colour; but Lucy's eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew.
Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in which they have rooms.
When I came back from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.
When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy, and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter.
Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra.
As he did so we heard Mr. Morris's voice without:  "Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about it."
This morning, when I went to see him after his repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.
At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman's heavy tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro.
Hildesheim cleared the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky.
Van Helsing smiled in turn.
"When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.
Lucy went out visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did not go.
Van Helsing turned to him quickly and said:  "God will act in His own way and time.
That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day.
You think then that those so small holes in the children's throats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?"
It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much between then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and no news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a partner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and Jonathan with another attack that may harm him.
Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van Helsing saw us.
Harker cried out.
In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count Dracula, as it may help me to understand.
After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.
True to our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness.
Even friend Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!
Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously ill.
Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.
They learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due.
