It occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which Ben Gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and I should know where to look for one.
Blackbeard was a child to Flint.
But when they saw Redruth waiting for them in the sparred galley, they went about ship at once, and a head popped out again on deck.
And how many on yours, Mr. Trelawney?
Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble.
He knew the passage like the palm of his hand, and though the man in the chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart, John never hesitated once.
Why, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but gen'lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you don't make no doubt of that.
That was Flint's treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the lives of seventeen men from the HISPANIOLA.
Now, to tell you the truth, from the very first mention of Long John in Squire Trelawney's letter I had taken a fear in my mind that he might prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I had watched for so long at the old Benbow.
When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow (as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present.
And come to think on it, it was like Flint's voice, I grant you, but not just so clear-away like it, after all.
At the Sign of the Spy-glass WHEN I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John Silver, at the sign of the Spy-glass, and told me I should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign.
Crawling on all fours, I made steadily but slowly towards them, till at last, raising my head to an aperture among the leaves, I could see clear down into a little green dell beside the marsh, and closely set about with trees, where Long John Silver and another of the crew stood face to face in conversation.
So? cried Silver.
Black Dog?
Mr. Trelawney, being a very open-handed gentleman, as we all know, has just asked me a word or two, and as I was able to tell him that every man on board had done his duty, alow and aloft, as I never ask to see it done better, why, he and I and the doctor are going below to the cabin to drink YOUR health and luck, and you'll have grog served out for you to drink OUR health and luck.
Dogger, said Mr. Dance, you have a good horse; take up this lad behind you.
Mr. Hands, he said, here are two of us with a brace of pistols each.
Before a big fire lay Captain Smollett; and in a far corner, only duskily flickered over by the blaze, I beheld great heaps of coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold.
Well, I tell you now, replied the lad, I didn't half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you, John; but there's my hand on it now.
Gray and Ben Gunn came and went with the boat, while the rest during their absences piled treasure on the beach.
And when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim.
Well, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this.
Take your hat, Hawkins, and we'll see the ship.
Hawkins, help yourself, and back to your post to eat it, continued Captain Smollett.
Well, let 'em come, lad let 'em come, said Silver cheerily.
Understand me, Jim, he said, returning.
Long John Silver unearthed a very competent man for a mate, a man named Arrow.
“Aye, aye, sir!” answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the Admiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could see them pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were surprised to find the door open.
Only, he added, I'm glad I trod on Master Pew's corns, for by this time he had heard my story.
What he would do afterwards whether he would try to crawl right across the island from North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long Tom, trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him was, of course, more than I could say.
And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you wouldn't go for to sell Ben Gunn?
Come aboard, Mr. Hands, I said ironically.
I'll chance it with the sperrits, Jim.
Mr. Trelawney, you are the best shot you and Gray will take this long north side, with the five loopholes; it's there the danger is.
Aye, here it is: 'Capt.
On the top of that the three gentlemen went below, and not long after, word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the cabin.
We can count, I take it, on your own home servants, Mr. Trelawney?
You'll perhaps batten down your hatches till you're spoke to, my friend, cried Silver truculently to this speaker.
That would have been Flint's, or Billy Bones's.
We're all forecastle hands, you mean, snapped Silver.
J. F., and a score below, with a clove hitch to it; so he done ever.
Maybe you don't count it nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day you, John, with your head broke or you, George Merry, that had the ague shakes upon you not six hours agone, and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel to this same moment on the clock?
Three, reckoned the captain; ourselves make seven, counting Hawkins here.
John Trelawney Postscript I did not tell you that Blandly, who, by the way, is to send a consort after us if we don't turn up by the end of August, had found an admirable fellow for sailing master a stiff man, which I regret, but in all other respects a treasure.
Belay there, John! said Merry.
And you don't like Mr. Arrow?
But the rations are short, very short so short, Dr. Livesey, that we're perhaps as well without that extra mouth.
Here's Cap'n Flint
I saw him dead with these here deadlights, said Morgan.
But Dick was not to be comforted; indeed, it was soon plain to me that the lad was falling sick;
Hunter, take the east side, there.
Dick was gone but a little while, and during his absence Israel spoke straight on in the cook's ear.
Long John's earrings, they were called; and he would hand himself from one place to another, now using the crutch, now trailing it alongside by the lanyard, as quickly as another man could walk.
Pew, he cried, they've been before us.
The colour went from their six faces like enchantment; some leaped to their feet, some clawed hold of others; Morgan grovelled on the ground.
Mr. Dance, said the squire, you are a very noble fellow.
Silver briefly agreed, and this emissary retired again, leaving us together in the dark.
But by this time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it was new, that night, to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed it did not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite angrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on a new cure for the rheumatics.
Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after?
And if them pirates camp ashore, Jim, what would you say
While I was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like a sea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor's walk.
Silver's face was radiant.
Long before it was done, Mr. Trelawney (that, you will remember, was the squire's name) had got up from his seat and was striding about the room, and the doctor, as if to hear the better, had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll.
Most likely Trelawney's own men, said the doctor; those he had picked up for himself before he lit on Silver.
If I don't have a dram o' rum, Jim, I'll have the horrors; I seen some on 'em already.
It is for you to speak, says Mr. Trelawney grandly.
Now, you see, Jim, so be as you ARE here, says he, I'll give you a piece of my mind.
Israel, said Silver, your head ain't much account, nor ever was.
Jim, he said, you're the only one here that's worth anything, and you know I've been always good to you.
Silver was the captain, and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it.
For it was this same boy that faked the chart from Billy Bones.
You'll make a famous cabin-boy, Hawkins.
It was a story that profoundly interested Silver; and Ben Gunn, the half-idiot maroon, was the hero from beginning to end.
First ship that ever I lost, said Captain Smollett.
And as for you, John Silver, long you've been a mate of mine, but you're mate of mine no more.
If you won't, my name is Alexander Smollett
Jim, that's one to you.
Lad, said Silver, no one's a-pressing of you.
Ah, Silver! says he.
I'm Ben Gunn
You and me should get on well, Hawkins, for I'll take my davy
Oh, I reckon that'll be Alan.
They was the roughest crew afloat, was Flint's; the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them.
Oh, I know'd Dick was square, returned the voice of the coxswain, Israel Hands.
Well, you've about fixed it now, among you, continued Silver.
Good evening, Dance, says the doctor with a nod.
Silver's parrot?
When we came on deck, the men had begun already to take out the arms and powder, yo-ho-ing at their work, while the captain and Mr. Arrow stood by superintending.
Now, if you had sailed along of Bill, you wouldn't have stood there to be spoke to twice not you.
This was the first that Jim heard, the sound of the squire's shot not having reached him.
Captain, said I, Trelawney is the dead shot.
Aye, aye, mates, said Long John, who was standing by, with his crutch under his arm, and at once broke out in the air and
He can't 'a found the treasure, said old Morgan, hurrying past us from the right
Pew was that sort, and he died a beggar-man.
Silver never moved; he watched them, very upright on his crutch, and looked as cool as ever
Come away, Hawkins, he would say; come and have a yarn with John.
Billy took me in.
Nay, and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with Dr. Livesey, even then what danger lay before us!
Jim, I told him.
